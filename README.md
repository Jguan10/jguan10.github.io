# Hello There!

Greetings and welcome to my page! My name is Jiaxiong Guan but I also go by Jason!
I'm a CS student at CUNY Hunter College looking to pursue data science.
I love writing poems, watching anime, and learning where the best spots to eat are!
I hope you enjoy your stay and feel free to reach out and contact me:
